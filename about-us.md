## Why 906.sh

The Upper Peninsula (the “906”) runs on neighbor‑to‑neighbor trust and getting things done with what you have. **906.sh** is a practical toolkit and playbook for small orgs and small towns—built in the open, sized for reality, and respectful of tight budgets and thin staff.

### The 906.sh Approach

* **Start small, nail the basics:** Good email, a reliable website, simple backups, and clear how‑tos beat fancy buzzwords.
* **Open + Documented:** Everything we adopt is teachable and reproducible.
* **Local capacity over lock‑in:** We aim to hand off—not hook in.

## The 906.sh Stack (Right‑Sized & Boring‑Good)

> **Goal:** Sensible defaults that your future self can maintain.

* **Identity & Email:** Safe baselines (MFA, strong policies) using widely available tools.
* **Web:** Lightweight sites, monitored; auto‑backed‑up content.
* **Backups:** 3‑2‑1 in practice, encrypted, and test restores on a schedule.
* **Access:** Simple VLANs where helpful, a couple of VPN tunnels, and clear user roles.
* **Observability:** Uptime pings, a few key logs/alerts, quiet by default.
* **Security:** Least privilege, automatic updates where it won’t break things, written “oh‑no” runbooks.

> 🧭 **Principles:** Prefer simple • Write it down • Automate only after it’s stable • Choose tools you can explain at a potluck.

## Impact, Measured

* **Access:** # of organizations with secure email/identity and published web presence.
* **Resilience:** RTO/RPO improvements; % with off‑site/immutable backups and tested restores.
* **Capacity:** Yoopers trained & certified; local admin hand‑offs completed.
* **Equity:** Devices placed, network coverage added, elder‑care digital assistance touchpoints.
* **Economic Lift:** Local revenue retained via local providers and talent.

## 2028 Path (Sketch, not a promise)

1. **Tiny Pilots (now → 2027):** A handful of partners at a time; ship the basics; write the recipe.
2. **Public Playbook (2027):** Publish the 906.sh recipes and templates; open community contributions.
3. **Slow‑and‑steady Scale (post‑2028):** Train local caretakers, iterate the docs, keep the lights on.

---

## How to Get Involved

* **Community leaders & orgs:** Bring a small, concrete need (email, website, backups). We’ll start there.
* **Technologists:** Contribute recipes, docs, or field‑tested fixes.
* **Educators & libraries:** Host a short workshop—security basics, backups, or digital housekeeping.
* **Everyone else:** Tell us what hurts and what already works. The playbook improves with your stories.

---

## Governance & Accountability

* **Open Playbooks:** Document defaults, cost models, and change logs.
* **Community Advisory:** Local stakeholders shape priorities and review outcomes.
* **Security Board:** External reviewers for policy, backups, and incident response.
