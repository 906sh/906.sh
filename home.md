## Welcome

**906.sh** is a tiny, practical toolkit for Yooper orgs and small businesses—email that’s safe, websites that load, backups that restore, and notes you can hand off.

> Start small. Nail the basics. Write it down.

---

## About

We’re building a right‑sized, open set of recipes for identity, websites, backups, and simple monitoring—so local teams can keep things running without a full IT department.

---

## Projects

* **906Online:** Managed basics for small orgs.
* **NorthernWISP:** Free guides and how‑tos.
* **YooperConnect:** Community listings & tech nights.
* **906 Lab:** Tiny experiments that become stable recipes.

## Playbook

* **Email & Identity:** MFA, safer defaults, quick setup.
* **Web & Content:** Fast, accessible pages with backups.
* **Backups:** 3‑2‑1, encrypted, test restored.
* **Observability:** Quiet pings, a few alerts, clear runbooks.

> The playbook grows with your notes. Share what works.
